## Security Infrastructure Status

### üìã Requirements Management
- ‚úÖ **requirements.txt**: All packages pinned to secure versions
- ‚úÖ **requirements-lock.txt**: Regenerated with 45 packages and SHA256 hashes
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographic verification**: Real hashes from PyPI

### üîç Security Scanning
- ‚úÖ **pip-audit**: Integrated for vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **CI/CD security workflow**: GitHub Actions with Trivy and pip-audit
- ‚úÖ **License compliance**: Automated validation
- ‚úÖ **Dependency validation**: Comprehensive checks

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Scripts
- ‚úÖ **Hash generator**: Production-grade cryptographic verification
- ‚úÖ **Dependency checker**: Multi-layer security validation
- ‚úÖ **License validator**: Compliance verification
- ‚úÖ **Deploy validator**: Pre-deployment security checks

## Current Environment Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Cleanup Required**
- 241 packages installed but not in lock file
- These are development/build artifacts not production dependencies
- Lock file contains only 45 required production packages

### Recommended Actions

1. **For Production Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Use clean environment with lock file
   pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-lock.txt
   ```

2. **For Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Clean install with development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Run security scan
   pip-audit --desc

   # Validate deployment readiness
   python scripts/security/deploy-validator.py
   ```
