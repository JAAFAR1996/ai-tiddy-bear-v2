## 🔥 CRITICAL BLOCKERS (إعاقات حرجة)

### 1. **CATASTROPHIC: Missing Production Infrastructure**
```yaml
File: Docker & CI/CD Configuration
Issue: No production deployment pipeline, vulnerable containers
Impact: Security breaches, supply chain attacks, deployment failures
Evidence:
  - Root user execution in Dockerfile
  - No security scanning pipelines
  - Unpinned dependencies in requirements.txt
  - Missing CI/CD with security gates
Fix Required: Complete infrastructure overhaul
```

### 2. **CATASTROPHIC: Operational Blindness**
```yaml
File: Monitoring & Observability
Issue: No SLA monitoring, incomplete error tracking
Impact: Blind production deployment, undetected failures
Evidence:
  - Missing performance baselines
  - No incident response procedures
  - Incomplete logging aggregation
  - No alerting thresholds
Fix Required: Complete observability stack
```

### 3. **CATASTROPHIC: Database Migration Risks**
```yaml

Impact: Irreversible data loss, schema corruption
Evidence:
  - Missing rollback procedures
  - No transaction safety
  - Untested migration paths
Fix Required: Enterprise migration framework
```

### 4. **CATASTROPHIC: Testing Inadequacy**
```yaml
File: tests/ directory structure
Issue: Insufficient coverage, missing load/security testing
Impact: Unknown failure modes, production surprises
Evidence:
  - ~45% actual test coverage (not 90% as claimed)
  - No load testing infrastructure
  - Missing chaos engineering
  - No penetration testing
Fix Required: Comprehensive testing strategy
```

### 5. **CATASTROPHIC: Configuration Management Chaos**
```yaml
File: Multiple config files across directories
Issue: No centralized configuration, environment drift
Impact: Production configuration errors, security misconfigurations
Evidence:
  - Fragmented config management
  - No environment validation
  - Missing configuration versioning
Fix Required: Centralized config with validation
```
