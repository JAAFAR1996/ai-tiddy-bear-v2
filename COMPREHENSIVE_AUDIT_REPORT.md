## 4. Dependencies Audit

This section provides a detailed analysis of the project's dependencies.

### 4.1. All Installed Packages

A complete list of all installed packages and their versions has been saved to `all_dependencies.txt`.

### 4.2. Unused Dependencies

The `deptry` tool identified a significant number of dependencies that are defined in `requirements.txt` but are not used in the codebase. Removing these unused dependencies will reduce the project's size and security footprint.

**Unused Dependencies:**
*   `pydantic-extra-types`
*   `asyncpg`
*   `alembic`
*   `hiredis`
*   `passlib`
*   `python-multipart`
*   `argon2-cffi`
*   `python-dateutil`
*   `iso8601`
*   `phonenumbers`
*   `anthropic`
*   `transformers`
*   `torch`
*   `sentence-transformers`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `soundfile`
*   `webrtcvad`
*   `langdetect`
*   `nltk`
*   `profanity-check`
*   `orjson`
*   `pyyaml`
*   `toml`
*   `websockets`
*   `structlog`
*   `loguru`
*   `pytest-asyncio`
*   `pytest-cov`
*   `pytest-mock`
*   `factory-boy`
*   `black`
*   `isort`
*   `flake8`
*   `mypy`
*   `bandit`
*   `safety`
*   `injector`
*   `strawberry-graphql`
*   `graphql-core`
*   `ariadne`
*   `graphene`
*   `celery`
*   `flower`
*   `environs`
*   `click`
*   `pillow`
*   `opencv-python`
*   `imageio`
*   `fernet`
*   `pyotp`
*   `python-slugify`
*   `humanize`
*   `rich`
*   `typer`
*   `pathlib2`
*   `apscheduler`
*   `croniter`
*   `babel`
*   `pytz`
*   `memory-profiler`
*   `line-profiler`
*   `pyserial`
*   `paho-mqtt`
*   `bleak`
*   `detoxify`
*   `better-profanity`
*   `perspective-api`
*   `mlflow`
*   `wandb`
*   `optuna`
*   `semgrep`
*   `pip-audit`
*   `mkdocs`
*   `mkdocs-material`
*   `kubernetes`
*   `docker`
*   `setuptools`
*   `wheel`
*   `pip`

### 4.3. Missing Dependencies

The `deptry` tool also identified several packages that are imported in the code but are not listed in `requirements.txt`. These should be added to the requirements file to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment.

**Missing Dependencies:**
*   `main` (from `run.py`)
*   `infrastructure` (multiple files)
*   `pybreaker`
*   `presidio_analyzer`
*   `presidio_anonymizer`
*   `aiokafka`
*   `Any` (from `typing`)
*   `Optional` (from `typing`)

### 4.4. Security Vulnerabilities

A `pip-audit` scan revealed **30 known vulnerabilities** in 14 packages. These vulnerabilities pose a significant security risk and must be addressed before deploying to production.

**Vulnerable Packages:**
*   `aiohttp`
*   `browser-use`
*   `cryptography`
*   `jinja2`
*   `mcp`
*   `python-jose`
*   `requests`
*   `sentry-sdk`
*   `setuptools`
*   `starlette`
*   `text-generation`
*   `torch`
*   `transformers`
*   `urllib3`

## 7. Code Quality Metrics

This section covers various metrics related to the quality of the source code.

### 7.1. Test Suite Health & Coverage

**CRITICAL FINDING: The test suite is fundamentally broken and non-executable.**

An attempt to run the test suite using `pytest` resulted in a catastrophic failure during the test collection phase, with **86 errors** preventing any tests from actually running. This indicates a severe lack of maintenance and a complete breakdown of the project's quality assurance process.

The primary error types encountered during collection were:
*   `IndentationError`: Basic Python syntax errors are present in multiple test files.
*   `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError`: Widespread issues with missing or incorrect imports (e.g., `fastapi_users_sqlalchemy`, `PluginSandbox`). This points to incorrect dependency management and architectural decay.
*   `AttributeError`: Indicates incorrect usage of modules and libraries (e.g., `module 'uuid' has no attribute '_uuid_generate_time'`).

**Test Coverage:**

Due to the test collection failure, a meaningful test coverage report cannot be generated. The `coverage` tool reported a **total coverage of 22%**, but this number is highly misleading. It primarily reflects the code paths that were touched during the import phase before the errors occurred, not actual test execution.

**Conclusion:** The project currently has **no effective test coverage**. The test suite requires a complete overhaul before any level of code quality or stability can be assured.
