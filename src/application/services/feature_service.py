"""Manages feature availability and parental controls for the AI Teddy Bear.

This service allows for the dynamic enabling and disabling of features based
on child age, parental consent, and safety considerations. It ensures that
features are only accessible when appropriate, adhering to COPPA compliance
and providing a customizable experience for each child.
